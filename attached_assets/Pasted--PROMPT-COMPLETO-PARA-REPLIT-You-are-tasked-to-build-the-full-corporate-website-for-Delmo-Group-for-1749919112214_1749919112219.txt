1Ô∏è‚É£ Sargassum Management Feasibility ‚Äî Punta Cana, Dominican Republic
Delmo Group, in partnership with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), is leading a comprehensive feasibility study for the large-scale collection, processing, and management of sargassum algae in Punta Cana, Dominican Republic.

This Blue Economy initiative addresses one of the region‚Äôs most pressing environmental challenges, with the goal of converting sargassum into sustainable bio-based products while protecting local marine ecosystems.

Through strategic collaboration with international financial institutions and public agencies, Delmo Group develops scalable models that support ecological preservation and responsible economic development throughout the Caribbean.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Cruz Malta ‚Äî Buenos Aires
Cruz Malta is a large heritage-listed building located in the center of Buenos Aires. This project involved the adaptive reuse of the existing structure while preserving its architectural integrity. The design challenge was to introduce a mezzanine level within limited ceiling height constraints, while maintaining adequate natural light and ventilation. The solution incorporated two large atriums at the core of the building, enhancing openness and functionality. The result is a modern office space of 25,000 sqm, accommodating approximately 1,500 staff. The property was successfully leased to HSBC under a 10-year agreement.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Walsh Bay ‚Äî Sydney
This multi-award-winning urban renewal project covers 17 hectares in Sydney‚Äôs historic Rocks precinct. The development involved the restoration of historic wharves and foreshore structures, alongside the sensitive redevelopment of surrounding properties. Delmo Group‚Äôs expertise in re-piling, gained from the Finger Wharf project, contributed significantly to the technical execution. The project successfully preserved important industrial archaeology, now integrated into the public realm as part of Sydney‚Äôs maritime heritage. Walsh Bay today includes over 350 residences, complemented by cultural, commercial, retail, and public facilities.

Project Value: $650 million

4Ô∏è‚É£ Finger Wharf ‚Äî Sydney
The Finger Wharf project involved the redevelopment and adaptive reuse of the largest timber wharf structure in the Southern Hemisphere. Engineering challenges included replacing 100-year-old deteriorating timber piles, requiring the installation of steel-cased, reinforced concrete piles designed for a 100-year service life. This enabled the full restoration of the timber wharf, which was transformed into 350 luxury residences, a premium hotel, retail spaces, a marina, and fine dining venues, all integrated within a preserved heritage setting.

Project Value: $300 million

5Ô∏è‚É£ The Bond ‚Äî Sydney
Located on Sydney‚Äôs waterfront, The Bond project required full site remediation of environmental contamination from the city's first gasworks facility. The completed development includes Australia‚Äôs first 5-star eco-rated commercial office building (Lend Lease global headquarters), 49 residential apartments, refurbished heritage Bond Stores, and a new public plaza. The project exemplifies the integration of environmental sustainability with adaptive reuse of historical industrial sites.

Project Value: $180 million

6Ô∏è‚É£ The Peninsula ‚Äî Sydney
Delmo Group undertook the remediation and redevelopment of the former heritage-listed Colgate Palmolive factory in East Balmain. The site presented complex contamination challenges due to its industrial maritime history. After extensive remediation, excavation, and preservation works, the building was converted into 111 high-end apartments and 10 townhouses, set on approximately 3 acres of waterfront land, with associated parking and public open spaces.

Project Value: $60 million

7Ô∏è‚É£ Binary Centre ‚Äî Sydney
The Binary Centre is a 17,700 sqm, purpose-built office complex located in Riverside Corporate Park. Designed to achieve a 4-star rating under the Australian Building Greenhouse Rating (ABGR) scheme, the building accommodates over 1,000 staff across two six-level office towers, with three levels of basement parking for 600 vehicles. The project reflects Delmo Group‚Äôs technical capacity in delivering institutional-grade commercial assets incorporating sustainable design principles.

Project Value: $80 million
